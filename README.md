# Flocking-Algorithm
Visualizing the flocking algorithm in Unity 3D. Boids is an artificial life program, developed by Craig Reynolds in 1986, which simulates the flocking behavior of birds.

The rules applied for the simplest motion in a Boids system are:
1. Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates.
2. Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position (center of mass) of local flockmates
3.Separation: steer to avoid crowding local flockmates.

Playing with these values and adding constraints also give amazing visualization.
